##  Image denoiser using opencv python
![copy](https://github.com/Onnesok/Image-denoiser-using-opencv-python/blob/main/banner.png)
 
 This is one of my experiment to see how I can manipulate images using opencv and python. This code shows how to denoise image in several methods. Here I've used gaussian blur, median blur, bilateral filter,
 non local denoise and wavelet denoise method to denoise the image.

## Installation

First create a virtual environment named denoiser to avoid package conflicts. use ``cmd or bash`` to do it.

```bash
python3 -m venv denoiser
```
Now source or activate environment.
#### For linux

```bash
source ./denoiser/bin/activate
```

#### For windows cmd

```bash
denoiser\Scripts\activate
```

## Install packages
For latest version......
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib opencv-python pywavelets
```

Now select interpreter of vs code to your selected virtual environment from the bottom right corner.

You are done and good to go....

Happy coding !
